            <h2>08. The Digital Craftsman</h2>
            <p>In Memory of Steve Jobs</p>
            <p>I'm not as prodigious (or, indeed, as good) of a writer as Frank. His piece today was both beautiful and
                spot on. As such, my thoughts here will skew a bit more personal. It is a strange thing to mourn the
                death of someone whom you have never met.</p>

            <h2>07. Friendship Is Emergent</h2>
            <p>Amateur Thoughts On A Working Theory For Friendship</p>
            <p>Today I starting thinking about the binary status of social networking. The idea of distinctly marking
                someone as a "friend" or "not a friend" has seemed too simplistic and distant to me (and to many others)
                when compared with our real-world experiences making, maintaining, and losing these friendships.</p>
